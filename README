Dependencies:
- Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit for Python and C++ (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/maxent_toolkit.html)

How to run the code:

# Compile the code
$ ./compile.sh

# Train the model
$ ./train.sh train.txt train.model # Note that train.model is a directory containing multiple model files

# Test the model
$ ./tester.sh train.model


# Explanation of code:
N-gram models are implemented in Ngrammodel.py, Unigram.py, Bigram.py, ..., Eightgram.py
The maximum entropy is implemented as Maxent.py
The interpolation is done by interpolate.py
Training and interpolation is mainly handled by InterpolatedModel.py
Testing is handled by write_model_predictions.py
